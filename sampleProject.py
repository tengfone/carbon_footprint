"""
What problem is your project trying to solve?
Teaching students simple maths additional and subtraction.

Why did you pick that problem?
To improve on student maths skills

How does your project solve that problem?
By making it into a highscore game, more interactive and fun.

Does your project have a name? What is it?
BeatMe@Math

Describe how your project works? What are the inputs & outputs?
Highscore math game. Input will be the answer for the math game. Output is telling me the points system

What Python concepts taught in class did you use?
---

Write the sample output for your project here:
Welcome To Math Game. Beat the high score of {highscore}.
